# UQAC – Discrete Event Simulation Models for Supply Chain – Atelier 2

## Students

This repository is the result of a collaborative effort by two students from the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC):

* **CHAKORI SEMMANE Alaâ**
* **MANSOURI Salim** 

## Course Information

This repository was created as part of **Atelier 2** at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC), within the context of a graduate program focused on Artificial Intelligence and Operations Research.

## Context and Purpose

The goal of this workshop is to allow students to deepen their understanding of AI-related techniques by engaging with real academic research. Working in teams of two, we take on the role of junior researchers and are tasked with exploring existing scientific contributions, understanding their models, and reflecting on how they can be reused or extended.

For this project, we selected and studied the work of:

* **Neha Karanjkar**
* **Tushar Lone**

Available at: [InventOpt GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SupplyChainSimulation/InventOpt)

This original project proposes simulation-based optimization tools for inventory and supply chain systems. It models decision-making under uncertainty using discrete event simulation, which is a powerful method for analyzing how complex systems evolve over time.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, we aim to:

* Develop a clear understanding of discrete event simulation models applied to supply chain management.
* Analyze the structure and functioning of an academic codebase.
* Adapt, extend, or experiment with the provided models to explore new research or practical use cases.
* Improve our ability to communicate technical findings in a clear and structured way.

## Repository Content

This repository includes:

* Our adapted and restructured code derived from the original InventOpt project.
* Experimentation files and test cases.
* Notes and documentation summarizing our analysis of the model.
* A progressive report detailing our work and reflections during the workshop sessions.

## Broader Goals

By engaging in this activity, we are not only applying technical skills, but also learning how to approach scientific work critically. The ability to understand and build upon existing research is key for careers in both academia and industry. This workshop is a first step in that direction.
